This project was a midterm project for my algorithms and data structures class at Baruch College

Requirements for the project were: 

Ability to insert, look, remove, insert, move, and copy a "file".
Ability to show directory structure.
An undo option.
Sorting a specified directory.
Make sure to use implementation.
Structuring the Directory into a BST. Navigating BST for look function.
